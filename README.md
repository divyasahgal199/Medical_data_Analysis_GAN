This dataset will be used to train the CTGAN model for generating synthetic data. 

The initializes and trains a CTGAN model to generate synthetic tabular data. 

The fit() method trains the model on the real dataset data, considering categorical_features.

Training runs for 200 epochs with progress logs enabled using verbose=True.

This trains a Conditional Tabular GAN (CTGAN) to generate synthetic tabular data. 

It fits the CTGAN model on the real dataset data, using the specified categorical_features.

The model is trained for 200 epochs, with training progress displayed via verbose=True.
